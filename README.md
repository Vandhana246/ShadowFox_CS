- Jupyter Notebook
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) [optional for further classification]

## 📊 Key Outputs
- Visualized sentiment distribution using bar charts
- Generated word cloud to identify common keywords
- Labeled and categorized text data for clear interpretation

## 📷 Screenshots
Include relevant screenshots here (bar chart, word cloud, sample data output)

## ✅ Outcome
Successfully completed the sentiment analysis task by categorizing and visualizing emotional trends in the dataset. The project enhanced my understanding of natural language processing and data storytelling.
